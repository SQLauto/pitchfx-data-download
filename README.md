# pitchfx-data-download
This is a .NET console app to download and parse PitchF/X data. There is also a SQL script to create a database where the data will be stored. You will need to setup a password for the user, in my case pitchfxuser, and change the connection string in the program's app.config file. Running the application will collect all data between 2008 and 2015.
